For the turboGAN2d and turboGAN3d you will need the datasets field2d.pt and field.pt. you can download them in this links:

For training and using the .py scripts you will need to download and install pytorch-lightning as well. The version 0.7.6 runs well, there are still some issues with 0.8.x.

To train the GAN3d you will need also the pre-trained weights of GAN2d.
